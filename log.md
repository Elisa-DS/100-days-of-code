### Day 3: 09 of June, 2019

**Today's Progress**: I've been reading the book; "Learn Python 3 the Hard Way"- I've dowloaded the PDF of this book .
I'm also trying to understand better how works Github, I'm spending many hours reading about it.

**Thoughts** According to the author - Zed A. Shaw:
This book’s job is to teach you the three most essential skills that a beginning programmer needs to
know: reading and writing, attention to detail, and spotting differences. I’m super excited after read it, I think this is what I need to learn.
